# React OMDB API Project

## Overview

This project is a simple React application that interacts with the [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to fetch and display movie data. It was created as a learning exercise to understand the core concepts of React, including:

- **Props**: Passing data between components.
- **State**: Managing dynamic data within components.
- **Effect**: Performing side effects like fetching data.
- **Refs**: Accessing and manipulating DOM elements or persisting stateful values across renders.
- **API Fetching**: Using `fetch` to retrieve data from external APIs.

---

## Features

- **Search for Movies**: Input a movie title to fetch and display matching results.
- **Movie Details**: Click on a movie to view additional details (e.g., year, type, poster).
- **Dynamic UI Updates**: React to user input with state and props.
- **Error Handling**: Handle errors gracefully, such as invalid search terms or network issues.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes.

## Technologies

- **React**: Core framework for building the UI.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **OMDB API**: Data source for movie information.
